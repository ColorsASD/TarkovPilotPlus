# TarkovPilot+ extension

The additional features live in the `plus` Go package. This package does not
import the original application's `main` package and embeds its own frontend and
OCR helper files in the EXE. The original project's documentation is available
in the [upstream README](https://github.com/ggdiam/TarkovPilot/blob/master/README.md).

## Structure

- `item_window.go` — Item Scanner Wails window, encrypted API key, settings, English title OCR and manual search
- `item_tracking.go` — character selection, Items Tracker and inventory updates
- `inspect_clicks_windows.go` — automatic scan trigger after a click
- `paired_windows.go` — companion window startup, display and shutdown; a callback requests shutdown of the main application
- `internal/market` — catalog, prices, characters, requirements and the documented inventory update operation
- `internal/scanner` and `ocr` — local Tesseract engine, Inspect detection and OCR
- `frontend/dist` — Item Scanner frontend only; its Wails binding is `window.go.plus.ItemWindowApp`
- `update.go` — Plus release page and the update policy that prevents upstream EXE replacement
- `version.go` — independent Plus version and the shared `TarkovPilot+` window title
- `upstream.json` — original repository, commit and version used as the base

The frontend calls the exported Plus window methods through `window.go` and
receives updates through the `item-state` runtime event. Its HTML, CSS and
JavaScript are maintained directly in `frontend/dist`. The main frontend remains
in `app/frontend/dist`. Generated `app/frontend/wailsjs` bindings are ignored;
neither frontend imports them.

Paths beginning with `app/` in this document are relative to the repository root.
Build and test commands are described in [app/README.md](../README.md).

## Versions

The original TarkovPilot version remains in `app/version.go` (`2.1.0`). The Plus
version is maintained independently in `app/plus/version.go` (`1.0.0`). A Plus
build can increment only its own version; releasing the extension does not change
the original version. The Pilot heartbeat sends the original version to the
website. The UI labels both versions separately, while the release package's
`versions.json` also records the upstream commit. Wails and Windows EXE version
metadata use the Plus product name and version.

Every build creates `app/build/bin/TarkovPilotPlus-<version>-windows-x64/` and the
matching ZIP archive. Both contain `TarkovPilotPlus.exe`, `versions.json` and the
complete `ocr` directory. The executable name stays `TarkovPilotPlus.exe` even
when the build is given a custom compiler output filename. The current package
version is `1.0.0`.

The base is pinned in `app/plus/upstream.json` to
`ggdiam/TarkovPilot` commit `c1d4d219b8d951a5ba75dd913e8d6d2bbeebc847`, version
`2.1.0`. Update this manifest and the original version together when adopting a
new upstream release.

## Upstream updates

The exact original source can be retrieved from the Git commit in `upstream.json`.
The original API, configuration, detection and log watcher packages, as well as
the original updater, are unchanged from that pinned base and remain separate
from the Plus package. The Plus update policy disables automatic upstream update
checks and prevents replacing the combined application with the original EXE.
Users update manually from the
[Plus releases](https://github.com/ColorsASD/TarkovPilotPlus/releases).

The combined application still needs integration changes: `app/main.go` starts
and displays the companion window; `app/app.go` handles its shutdown, the two
versions, the shared log date format and the update policy. The main frontend has
English labels, shared closing and separate version displays. Wails build
settings use the Plus name and version. These integration points differ from
upstream; the complete main application is not an unchanged upstream copy.

When adopting a new upstream release:

1. Save the working tree changes in a separate commit first.
2. Confirm that the `upstream` remote points to `https://github.com/ggdiam/TarkovPilot`, run `git fetch upstream`, and merge the selected upstream commit on a separate development branch. Keep `app/plus` as the extension's own source.
3. Preserve the companion window lifecycle, the `plusVersion` state field, the English UI and the Plus update policy at the integration points.
4. Update `app/version.go` to the new original version and update `app/plus/upstream.json` with the matching upstream commit and version. Change the Plus version independently.
5. From `app`, run `plus/ocr/prepare.ps1` before `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...` so the OCR engine tests run. Check frontend rendering, Inspect recognition and paired window closing, then use `build.ps1` to create the combined package. Verify both versions in `versions.json` and the release archive's SHA256 file.

The OCR preparation script downloads pinned dependencies and verifies their
hashes at build time; the application uses the bundled engine and models at
runtime. Keep the matching `ocr` directory and its license notices with the EXE.

Every merge needs review. Separating the extension reduces conflicts but does
not replace checking the upstream changes and the integration points.
